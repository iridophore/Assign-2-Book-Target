David Quammen, in "Spillover" instills the fear of the unknown as he describes multiple mysteries of the pathogenic world.  He describes many detective stories of infectious disease researchers and health workers as they travel the world attempting to understand the origin and spread of pathogens, many as yet still unknown by science.  He describes how the spread of man into many previously untouched wildernesses has released pathogens that lay dormant or otherwise without hosts for a long time.  He describes how these pathogens evolve in several animal vectors over time until they are able to jump into humans.  That process of evolution in jumping hosts may take a long time or not as dictated by statistics.

The book is filled with many stories of new outbreaks of new diseases that mysteriously disappear and reappear or lie dormant.  At 592 pages the book is somewhat long with the same repeating story of so many pathogens and so little time.  Quammen has excerpted sections of the book to create two smaller books as there is plenty of material.  Interesting and very educational the book may, however, take several sittings to read all the way through.
